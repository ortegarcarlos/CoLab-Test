# Catalysis Mini: Simple, Self-Contained and Ready to Run

This repository contains a collection of **small, self‑contained Jupyter notebooks**, each focused on a *single* concept in reaction engineering or catalysis. The goal is to make technical topics easy to explore.

Let's make it accessible:
- **No programming** experience needed.  
- **No software** installation required.
- **Easy and quick** visualization of a concept.

All notebooks are designed to run directly in **Google Colab**, so you only need a browser. No setup, no dependencies, no programming experience required.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Short notebooks (usually 10–20 lines of code)  
- Clear explanations aimed at students and early‑career researchers  
- Visualizations of fundamental catalytic concepts  
- Code that runs top‑to‑bottom without modification  
- Links to open each notebook in Google Colab

## Why This Format?

Catalysis and reaction engineering are full of powerful ideas — Thiele modulus, effectiveness factors, diffusion limitations, rate expressions — but they can feel abstract without visualization.

These notebooks aim to:

- **Lower the entry barrier** for learners  
- Encourage exploration and intuition  
- Provide reproducible, transparent examples  
- Support teaching, mentoring, and self‑study

## Ideas for Future Notebooks

- η vs. φ for slabs and hollow cylinders  
- External mass‑transfer limitations (η_ext)  
- Weisz–Prater criterion  
- Effect of pellet size on diffusion limitations  
- Temperature effects on effectiveness factor  
- Simple reactor models (CSTR, PFR)  
- Adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Temkin)
